# horiseon-in-production

##  In this repository we were to refract an existing code to make the page more accessible and to make the code neater. 

I added titles to the sections and changed multiple <div> tags to more specific semantic elements. 

I made sure everything was linked correctly, and made sure tags were changed in the style sheet. 

I changed the path to the hero image. It was originally linked in the style sheet but I added it to index.html so that I could add an alt tag. 

There was a lot of duplicate code so I combined the classes and removed repetitive code. 

I added descriptions to all photos.

I updated the title of the webpage to be more descriptive.
