# horiseon-in-production

##  In this repository we were to refract an existing code to make the page more accesssible and to make the code neater. 

I added titles to the sections, changed multiple <div> tags to more specicific semantic elements, made sure everything was linked correctly, and made sure tags were changed in the style sheet.
